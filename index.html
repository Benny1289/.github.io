            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
                Hello there, my name is Benny Chen and this is my protfolio:
                <br/><br/>Throughout my High School career, I have taught myself a vast number of programming and hardware skills that I use to create a large number of inventions and ideas. These skills are used to create all the programs and designs seen below. Some of these skills include proficiency in languages like Java, JavaScript, C, C++, Python, and HTML5, while also being skilled in electronic devices like Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and building circuit boards.

                Below is a list of projects that I have worked on over my High School career. The list also contains an overview, skills used, and links to the projects(if accessible).

                                This was a project proposed by my cousin and I to create a next-generation nebulizer, equipped with wireless connectivity for portability, and a better interface. The design uses Android Studio to create an app that is uploaded into a tablet; the tablet then is connected to a custom circuit board. The circuit board gathers information like the air quality, temperature, and humidity to forward to the tablet, which displays the information. The tablet also stops the system if a critical level is reached or the time limit is reached. The tablet also has a custom entertainment system, aimed toward kids, for playful use. The next next-generation nebulizer is being rolled out in the middle-east and authorized by the department of health for use in the United States. Currently, the product is being patented, and due to that I can not divulge any of the specifics, like the circuitry or code, for legal reasons until the process is complete.

                                This program was created to calculate a students GPA, either through their high school carrer or only a certain year. The program was created due to many students not being able to see their GPA's from Powerschool and not knowing how to calculate it. With this program, students are able to easily calculate their GPA's.
